# _printf
  This Repo has has all the code necessary for our (IBRAHIM MORKETA and Marwane Nouh) custom function called _printf(). It is a mini-version of C Language  function printf() from stdio.h, and our function _printf() attempts to replicate the exact same process as the C function printf(). This project was completed as a part of the curriculum for a software development program
